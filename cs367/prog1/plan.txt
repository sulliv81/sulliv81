1. This program is checking the ability to implement a connection of host and 
client through sockets. Upon establishing the connection, the client will
play a guessing game with the server to check if it guesses the secret number.
You can only win if you guess it on turn 1 of whatever round.  If you continually 
guess wrong, you can get hints if you are within a certain error of margin and
may also lose if you push the secret number outside its bounds, as it changes
every guess.

2. I anticipate allowing for other clients to be handle be the server with the
hint of seeing: fork to be a challenging aspect. I recall forks from cs 347 
and definitely remember their functionality, but hope to recall their 
implementation. I think from the book's example and the demo client/server 
that the connection will be a step-by-step process. I also guessing-game function
is straightforward and should be trivial to code.

3. Resources to utilize:
3i) The textbook on establishing a connection from a client to server. In the 
chapter on sockets, I already had noticed a sample demo connection with
accompanying code in C to reference.
3ii) I will also reference the demo_client and demo_server c files from our
canvas home pages under useful resources. I think this will be helpful in 
recalling to check for errors in my connection and data exchange process.
3iii) I will also make use of office hours and Piazza as needed as I step
through this project and hopefully can mitigate issues by starting sooner and 
being proactive in testing robustness.

4. Timeline:
1/17/2021 Have plan.txt done
1/18/2021 establish connections between client/server
1/19/2021 write guessing_game function()
1/20/2021 check implementation, check plan.txt and push to github
1/21/2021 Have initial implementation done to start fine-tuning 
1/22-29/2021 test, test, ask questions, check, test
1/30/2021 submit at 10 pm, if not sooner if complete
