2. All parts of program functioning.

3. Ways in which we tested our code were as follows:
    i) We first started by testing forking to make sure we were able have concurrent clients able to connect with The
        server and exchange guesses by loosely following a model of the demo_client/server.c programs.
    ii) We also tested our concurrent games by both playing as player1/2 individually from  our local PC's while also
        implementing our timeout feature.
    iii) There was also a good amount of testing with sending the board back and forth and generating the board. This took
    trial and error and a quick mistake we found was we weren't using the random seed for our variable to actually randomize 
    board each time.

4. The most challenging aspect of this project was implementing the sending of strings from client to server which ultimately
    resulted in reading the guidelines more thoroughly in which case we learned we send the size of the guess first so we can easily
    know how many bytes to read on the guess.
