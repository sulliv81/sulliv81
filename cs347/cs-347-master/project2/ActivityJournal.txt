Plan: My goal is to get read done first. I reckon if I understand read, then I
can implement write easily. I beleive  with fscanf and fread it will be an easy task,
but nothing in C ever seems easy upon implementation :). If I get read, I will move to write
to check if that works. I truly anticipate there to be the most issues with read.
Next will become the threadfn. I don't think that will be too terible, there will be alot
of syntax to be careful with calling to structs and casts to the paramter structs. I think
the formula won't be too bad as the professor supplied it with us and all the for loops.
The threads will of course be challenging and I will have to account for this by being cautious
and reading up. I am going to implement them with a for loop and then join them later with a for loop.
It actually sounds like a fun task and time to get rolling. Check back in for the completion
to see what happens next!
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Actual Time	35 00
Observations: No joke...35 hours of trying to track down seg faults and fix read. It was quite the
adventure. Learning a lot of joys about programming. At the end, I still could not figure out what plagued
my project so close and I truly feel something is ever so slightly off with a pointer or something that
is causing the final output to be distorted. Observations include coding in c is an arduous labor of love
but the better you get at debugging the smoother life can become. Stepping through gdb is such a useful
talent that I plan to keep moving on. Also the threading was probably the most easy to write method
for the entire assignment making the appropriate calls and populating the struct array as I went.
Overall this was a time consuming project and I definitely learned a lot from it.

Update: 11:37 pm day of due date. Huge thanks to Jack for emailing. Aftering cleaning up some errors
I saw that I also was not returning img->image in read and this was the hugest cause of errors in
reading images. Once I fixed that anc cleaned up the errors for compiling and readabilty, it worked!
Thank you so much for emailing me back, saved the night!
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
