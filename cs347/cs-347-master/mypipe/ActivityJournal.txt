Start: 11/17/2020
Estimated Time	04 00
Plan: First I plan to rewatch the zoom lecture. The assignment hits at strsep
so I will be visiting the man pages. It also looks like I will need strdup and
possibly strtok. I am thinking the challenge will be inparsing the input into smaller
inputs. Perhaps while loops and strtok will help with parsing smaller lines or char
arrays. I also need to do some research on forking and how this will relate to
the parent or child process and piping in general.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Actual Time	05 00
Observations: This proved to be more challenging than I thought and took a lot more
thought. Getting strsep to work and then remembering the arguments could be a list
of commands was forgotten until late today. I decided to parse the lhs and rhs args
by using strdup and strsep. Then one will represent a left and right side and to parse
those, I then go through with strtok and a while loop to whittle them away into a 
char array. After that, I do checks for NULL args being passed and if so run the
default ones. I am getting a seg fault though and I feel like it's coming from the fork but I am unsure exactly where.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
