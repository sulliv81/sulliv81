Plan: My plan of attack is to first and always start by reviewing the in class
lectures and slides.

FileStat looks like I need to understand a few concepts. First we need to return the file type.
I am thinking their is going to be a trick with a built in function for c that should
maket this part fairly pain-free.

Next I need to get the time of last access. I once again think that this should
not be inherently difficult, but will require some proper C syntax to get working.

Lastly, I need to list the read, write, and execute permissions. I know them from 
a list, but perhaps there will be an easier method to do this. The review notes the professor dicussed on 10/19 should help with this.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Observations: Making use of the struct stat was highly beneficial in solving this assignment.
After doing more manual page reads on stat(), lnode(), ctime(), and stat's mode features,
it opened the flood gates on this assignment. Making use printf commands with ternary conditionals 
really helped with printing the permissions as well as getting the file type. I hadn't used ternary
operators in quite some time, so it was fun to reimplement the thought process. I added a check
for a file or directory input and an accompanying messaged incase the user fails to run with 
the proper arguments. I had a heck of a time with st_atime and once I discovered printing it was
made easier by ctime(), life was great. Biggest obstacle was definitely the access time and
once you saw how to use stat and pull inforation, it was smooth sailing.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
